# ðŸ’¡ Bulk correlations

A simple python app to quickly uncover potential relationships in a CSV dataset by getting an overview of correlation coefficients between several pairs of metrics. Made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Usage:

1) Uploade a CSV file from the left sidebar. The format expected is: 
```
item,metric_1,metric_2,metric_3,etc
```
For example, for a GA4 export:
```
Address,Word Count,GA4 Sessions,GA4 Views,GA4 Engaged sessions,GA4 Bounce rate,Performance Score,First Contentful Paint Time (ms),Speed Index Time (ms),Largest Contentful Paint Time (ms),Time to Interactive (ms),Total Blocking Time (ms),Cumulative Layout Shift,Image Count

https://www.example.com/article-2/,114,5,5,1,0,61,2264,3316.94,8505,6850.5,418.5,0.059,6

...
```

2) The chart automatically appears under "Results:"
